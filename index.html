            Eucerin Anti-Pigment Skin Perfecting Serum 30ml has a
            fast-absorbing, ultra-light texture that effortlessly adheres to
            your skin, acting on pigmentation. In this sense, this clinically
            tested serum, when spread on the skin of the face, ends up
            brightening the complexion while reducing pigment spots and
            preventing new ones. In turn, the skin ends up looking more uniform,
            refined, hydrated, and with a natural radiant glow. For this to be
            possible, this serum is composed of a combination of powerful active
            ingredients, namely Thiamidol. This, in turn, is an effective and
            patented ingredient that acts on cutaneous hyperpigmentation,
            preventing its appearance by decreasing the production of melanin in
            the skin. Thus, the complexion is even while the dark spots are
            gradually disappearing.

            Ralph Lauren Polo Blue Eau de Parfum is a woody aromatic fragrance,
            created in 2016 by the nose of Carlos Benaim. Inspired by the
            freedom of the open ocean, this scent is perfect for men who
            identify with the equally powerful and soothing sea essence. In
            fact, this product is able to transport us to a completely new
            scenery with each spray. Through each application, you will feel
            like you are sailing under an overwhelmingly blue sky, with a
            reenergizing salty wind touching your face. The Polo Blue Eau de
            Parfum takes us on this journey thanks to an incredibly refreshing
            and invigorating composition. The olfactory storyline starts with
            fresh sea notes and juicy bergamot. Then, we enjoy an aromatic heart
            with notes of basil, verbena, clary sage, and orris. Lastly, sued,
            vetiver, woodsy notes, and patchouli create a sensual and warm base.
            Like so, an unmistakable and luxurious fragrance is born, flawlessly
            embodying Ralph Lauren’s passion for sports and refinement. Perfect
            for all year round but especially suitable for warmer nights, the
            Ralph Lauren Polo Blue Eau de Toilette is like a refreshing touch of
            freedom and dynamism.

          <p class="product-description">
            Clarins Roll-On Deodorant 50ml is an antiperspirant deodorant
            suitable for all skin types, even the most sensitive. Specifically,
            this product protects the armpits from bad odors thanks to the
            presence not only of a delicate soft fragrance but also of aluminum.
            During the day, perspiration is equally controlled and reduced, as
            well as the armpits gain an extremely comfortable dry feeling.
            Furthermore, this composition has extracts of Buchu Leaf, Hamamelis,
            and Rosemary. These not only regulate perspiration but also provide
            a pleasant feeling of freshness. In addition, through soothing
            properties, these ingredients help protect the vulnerable underarm
            epidermis after shaving specifically with razors or other products.
            In turn, as it does not contain alcohol, this deodorant becomes an
            anti-irritant suitable for more sensitive and irritated skin. All in
            all, bad odors are not only prevented but the armpits are perfectly
            soothed and fresh throughout the day.
